# IRAPT (Instantaneous pitch estimation based on RAPT framework)
IRAPT is a pitch estimation technique based on the robust algorithm for pitch tracking (RAPT) framework. IRAPT provides estimation of instantaneous pitch values and is not sensitive to rapid frequency modulations. The algorithm utilizes a different period candidate generating function based on instantaneous harmonic parameters.
